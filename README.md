# Feed Reader Testing

In this project, which was a part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegreee, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The aim was to build a comprehensive test suite using Jasmine to test the various functionalities of this app.


## Running the app

To run the application, either go to https://amalolan.github.io/fend-feedreader/ or if you want to view it locally, you can clone/download the repository and then open index.html file in your browser.

Once the page loads, wait a few seconds for all the tests to complete and then scroll to the bottom to view the results of the test

## Changing testing parameters

If you want to change testing parameters you can do so by editing the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file. For example, to change the page switched to, simply change the `var id = 2` in line 118 to whatever feed ID you want to change to.<br>
The feed IDs are as follows <br> `{1: Udacity Blogs, 2: CSS Tricks, 3:HTML5 Rocks, 4:Linear Digressions}`
